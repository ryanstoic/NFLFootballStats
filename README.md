# NFLFootballStats

Fantasy football owners and football enthusiasts need weekly NFL player stats to follow the the top players in the league. I discovered CBSSports hosts NFL stats in a table which can easily be scraped into a spreadsheet. Follow instructions below to get started. See **Examples** folder if you want to see the data retrieved 

# Get Started

1. Download files
2. Check **_requirements.txt_** and pip install anything missing (open command prompt and check "pip list" to see current packages)
3. Run **_main.py_** in your favorite text editor (i'm assuming you know how to run a python program if you are on github)
    * executes **_DefenseStats.py_**, **_KickingStats.py_**, **_PassingStats.py_**, **_ReceivingStats.py_**, and **_RushingStats.py_**
      * scrapes and saves **_defense_data.csv_**, **_kick_stats.csv_**, **_passing_data.csv_**, **_receiving_stats.csv_**, and **_rushing_data.csv_**
4. Open **_defense_data.csv_**, **_kick_stats.csv_**, **_passing_data.csv_**, **_receiving_stats.csv_**, and **_rushing_data.csv_** in Excel or Google Sheets
